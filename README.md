# Automating Obsidian With Templates
## Prerequisite Plugins:
- Templater
- DataView
- Meta Bind

## Assumed directory structure
- People are all in the `People` directory in the root of the Main Vault
- Meetins are in the `Meetings` directory in the root of the Main Vault
- MoCs (Maps of Content) are residing in `Map of Contents (MOC)` directory, but can be placed anywhere

If you want to change anything it is easy enough to do, but you need to put the new directory names inside the template definitions.
